Enron Email and Fraud Analysis

This project explores the Enron dataset, focusing on email clustering and fraud detection using machine learning techniques.

Overview
enron_email_clustering.ipynb:
In this notebook, KMeans clustering is applied to the Enron employees' emails. The goal is to group related emails together and uncover patterns within the communication data. The notebook also includes assumptions made during the analysis.

enron_fraud_models.ipynb:
This notebook dives into the financial data of the Enron team with a specific focus on fraud detection. Various machine learning models are created, trained, and evaluated to identify potential fraudulent activities within the financial records. The effectiveness of each model is assessed to determine their performance.

enron_over_under_sample_fraud_models.ipynb:
Addressing the challenge of imbalanced data, this notebook explores the techniques of under-sampling and over-sampling. By handling the imbalance in the dataset, the goal is to enhance the fraud detection models and improve their accuracy. The notebook provides insights into the impact of sampling strategies on model performance.

The project utilizes the Enron dataset, which includes email communications and financial data

Conclusion
This project serves as a comprehensive exploration of Enron's email and financial data, providing insights into communication patterns and fraud detection. The notebooks are designed to be flexible, allowing users to experiment and extend the analysis for their specific use cases.
